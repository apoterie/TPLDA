The TPLDA algorithm is described in the paper "Classification tree algorithm for grouped variables" written by A. Poterie, J.-F.Dupuy, V. Monbet, [L. Rouvière](https://github.com/lrouviere).

- File *Fonctions_TPLDA.R* contains the fonctions to built a TPLDA tree.

- File *application_real_datasets* contains codes and data used in the application introduced in the paper "Classification tree algorithm for grouped variables" written by A. Poterie, J.-F.Dupuy, V. Monbet, L. Rouvière.
